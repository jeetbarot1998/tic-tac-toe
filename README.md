Developed a networked Tic Tac Toe game using Python, Pygame, and socket programming to demonstrate my skills in client-server architecture and real-time data communication. The server, built with Python's socket library, handles multiple connections using multi-threading, enabling simultaneous games. Clients connect to the server, receive their player IDs, and exchange game data through continuous socket communication. The game logic, including player moves and win conditions, is managed by a custom game class, ensuring a seamless and interactive experience. This project showcases my expertise in network programming, real-time data handling, and game development using Pygame.
